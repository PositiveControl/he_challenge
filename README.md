# Hotel Engine Code Challenge
## Cryptocurrency Price Search

Simple search tool for getting the current price of a cryptocurrency by its ticker symbol

It is connected to the Binance Ticker API, which provides the current price for a given ticker symbol.

Queries must be in the form of a ticker (e.g. ETH, BTC)

API will only return tickers with USDT (Tether) pairs on Binance - so it's somewhat limited in results.
